## Task 2

Your final exam has five (5) questions; each question can be marked (0 - 100 marks.)
Write an implementation that will take user input (where the input is a mark for each question) and
calculate the overall grade for said final exam.

Grades can be:
* `A`
* `B`
* `C`
* `D`
* `F`

Grade ranges:
* `A` => 90 - 100
* `B` => 80 - 89
* `C` => 70 - 79
* `D` => 60 - 69
* `F` => (<60)

## Task 3

"Build a simple word game!"

The program should provide N letters with dashes that are part of a puzzle word. The player must guess the word.

Constrictions for the word's length:
* `N` > 0
* `N` < 6

Example: if the program provides the letters `A-E`, the puzzle word can be, “game” or “fame”;
         if the player provides the correct answer – they win the game.
